# Analysis of the League of Legends (LoL) dataset using Apache Spark
This is a Big Data Analytics project in which I analyzed the League of Legends dataset (~14 GB). The analysis is done using Apache Spark in Python (PySpark) in a Google Colab notebook.

The exact requirements that I worked on can be found in the project_description.pdf file. Also, a business report, that summarizes my findings, is attached. 

The used dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/d4sein/league-of-legends-patch-109).
