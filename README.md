# Analysis of the League of Legends (LoL) dataset using Apache Spark
The objective of this project is to use PySpark to analyze the League of Legends dataset (~14 GB) and find some useful statistics. Some statistics were performed using Spark Streaming as well. Lastly, a business report can be found where I presented my findings along with visualizations.  
The exact requirements can be found in the project_description.pdf file.
